This project uses [Upstash Kafka](https://upstash.com/), you can register an account and get required credentials there.

By default, it uses [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres) as the database provider, please follow their docs to setup database.

### Database

This project uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) and [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres), you may migrate to other ORMs and database provider if you wanted.

Push database changes:

```
pnpm run db:push
```

Please make sure all environment variables are all settled before running the command.

Learn More about Drizzle ORM from their [documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/quick-start).

## Project Structure

## Security

It'll checks for user permissions before doing any operations.

You can enable permission checking in a Server Action or Route Handler by doing:

```ts
import { checkPermissions } from "@/utils/actions/permissions";

export async function myAction() {
    "use server";

    //notice that it is an async function
    await checkPermissions();
}
```

## Scalability

### Don't depend on "Server"

We use Kafka for handling real-time operations via dashboard, so that no requests will be sent to the server that hosts the discord bot directly.

This brings a faster load speed and more better stability because the dashboad will still works even if the discord bot is temporarily unavailable.

### Serverless Ready

The dashboard is built for serverless, you are able to deploy it to any serverless hosting platforms such as Vercel, Azure and AWS.

<details>
  <summary>Notice that the Discord bot server can only be deployed to traditional Node.js Server hosting services, serverless environment is incompatible.</summary>
    
  Because they will connect to the Discord Gateway or even need a sharding manager which isn't suitable in a serverless environment.
</details>

## Typesafe

Typesafe is the key to maintain a large codebase. Although Javascript + JSDocs is perfect for libraries, it's still recommended to use Typescript for writing applications.

This template is fully written in Typescript, all the type errors will be reported at build time.

## Deploy

It is easy to deploy this application.

### Web App

The fastest way to deploy Next.js applications is to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=create-next-app&utm_medium=appdir-template&utm_campaign=create-next-app).

### Bot Server

Any hosting platform that supports Node.js, such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/deploy-nodejs-web-app/), [Render](https://render.com/), [Railway](https://railway.app/).
